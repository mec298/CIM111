        <p>The Shih Tzu is a sturdy, lively, alert toy dog with long flowing double coat. Befitting his noble Chinese ancestry as a highly valued, prized companion and palace pet, the Shih Tzu is proud of bearing, has a distinctively arrogant carriage with head well up and tail curved over the back. The coat, which comes in many colors, is worth the time you will put into it—few dogs are as beautiful as a well-groomed Shih Tzu.</p>

        <h1>FEEDING</h1>
        <p>Luckily there aren’t any outlandish requirements when it comes to the Shih Tzu diet, but there are a couple of things you should keep an out for when choosing their food.
Much like other toy dogs, the best food for the Shih Tzu is one that’s high in protein. This is because they burn calories faster, but as their stomachs are small, the food has to be low volume but calorie rich. The Shih Tzus’ defining luscious locks require care and attention, especially by including fat in their diets. Because their hair grows so rapidly, it’s important to ensure they’re getting all the good fats (Omega 3 and Omega 6) and Vitamin to keep their skin moisturized and hair healthy.</p>
